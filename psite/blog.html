                    <p class="p2">Hello my Name is Jorge, I am an entrepreneur. I was looking for help to guide in the process of a startup, I found Web World. Web World gave me a lot of information. The people who work there contributed a lot to my project. They called us twice a week to check how we are, how the startup was. After 6 month of guidance, my startup grew a lot and now I am preparing myself to receive 400 000 dollars for finance. I encourage you that if you are looking for help in this path, Web World is for you.</p>
