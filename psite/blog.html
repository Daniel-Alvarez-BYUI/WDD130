                    <p>Hello my name is Hanna, I am the owner of “GoodLife”. GoodLife offers healthy food, we offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. I wanted to expand my business, so I decided to have a web page to have more scope. Web Word offered me what I needed. The job web world did was awesome, my business grew a lot, I have more clients now, and SEO work was excellent. I am in the top 3 pages that google shows for healthy food in my city. I am happy to acquire the services of Web world, I suggest you do too.</p>

                    <p>Hello my Name is Jorge, I am an entrepreneur. I was looking for help to guide in the process of a startup, I found Web World. Web World gave me a lot of information. The people who work there contributed a lot to my project. They called us twice a week to check how we are, how the startup was. After 6 month of guidance, my startup grew a lot and now I am preparing myself to receive 400 000 dollars for finance. I encourage you that if you are looking for help in this path, Web World is for you.</p>

                    <p>I am the owner FaceNotebook, it is a social network. I needed 10 programmers that knew “react native”. We are developing programs with that technology. Web world facilitates to me the work of searching for capacitate programmers to accomplish the requirements I need, just I said to them what I need and the specifications ,and they already have programmers and we do not need to wait to teach them, the programmers already enter in the company to add value to the project. We are happy to work with Web World.</p>
