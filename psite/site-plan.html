      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h3>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p>
        When we dwelt in the presence of God our Heavenly Father, we were endowed with agency. This gave us the opportunity, the privilege, to choose what we would do—to make a free, untrammeled choice. When Father Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden, he was given this same power, and we now possess it. We’re expected to use the gifts and talents and abilities, the sense and judgment and agency with which we are endowed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        But on the other hand, we’re commanded to seek the Lord, to desire his Spirit, to get the spirit of revelation and inspiration in our lives. We come unto the Church and a legal administrator places his hands upon our head and says, “Receive the Holy Ghost.” This gives us the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the right to the constant companionship of that member of the Godhead, based on faithfulness. <br>
        And so we’re faced with two propositions. One is that we ought to be guided by the spirit of inspiration, the spirit of revelation. The other is that we’re here under a direction to use our agency, to determine what we ought to do on our own; and we need to strike a fine balance between these two, if we’re going to pursue a course that will give us joy and satisfaction and peace in this life and lead to eternal reward in our Father’s kingdom

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will be my landing page. I want to create a very attractive page that will show all the services I offer in my company. What I want is to make the people stay on the page as long as possible and leave personal information for contact with them.

      </ul>

      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        The idea of the blog is to share testimonies about our clients and how happy they felt with services they received. If customers see the work we already did for other people and if they like what they see, they will want the services of the company. My purpose here is that they be sure to take the services because of ifficency and the results I already shared.

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        My plan here is to get the information necessary for giving them specific information about what they are looking for.
