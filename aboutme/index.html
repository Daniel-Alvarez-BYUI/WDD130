    <p>Hello !!! My name is Daniel, I am 25 years old, I am from Santa Cruz de la sierra - Bolivia, in the center of south America, here in Santa Cruz we are going to have a temple yeahh !!!, next month we will have the Temple Groundbreaking. I am pursuing a degree in Applied technology. </p>
    <p>I served a mission in Uruguay Montevideo 2015-2017, I love play soccer, I like to swim, I am started swimming since I was 12 years,I do not have much time like I had when I was younger, now I swim to be in shape and have a good health</p>
    <p>I like BYU-i because we can learn and at the same time we can feel the spirit. We are surrounded by people who have the same principles, and in the process we help each other to improve. I love to learn about tech, in this case web development, because I see tech is growing extremely fast and the way it helps us to improve our lives is amazing,I want to be part of that process. I am really happy to be in BYU and learn about tech</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since I was 14 years old. One of my favorite quotes is one from Elder McConkie and it is the next one  “We’re expected to do everything in our power that we can and then to seek an answer from the Lord, a confirming seal that we’ve reached the right conclusion.”</p>
